## Basic Game Description
The game starts with 5 lanes that your hero may jump between while running. As he runs, he will encounter evil goblins standing in the lanes. Without a hammer, running into the goblins will cost him a life! But every once in a while, your hero will find a hammer. Picking up the hammer will give him the ability to smash any goblin he touches, and steal their money. But beware, the hammer will break after a short while, so attack quickly. As the player progresses, the game will progress with it making the game more challenging and rewarding as the hero lives on.

## Controls
The controls are very simple, only using the left and right arrow keys to jump to adjacent lanes.

## Scoring
The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible from smashing goblins before your hero's lives run out. Hammers, like goblins, appear randomly in the lanes, and will last a certain amount of time after being picked up before breaking. As the player plays, the number of coins dropped by each goblin will increase, but the time the hammer lasts before breaking decreases.

## Winning
Although there is technically no way to win **Hammer Run**, there is a high score board that will track which players achieve the most coins in a single playthrough. Despite there being no winning, there is an advancement system where the game gives more points, but becomes faster paced and more difficult the longer the hero stays alive.

## Losing
In order for there to be winners, there must first be losers. Losing **Hammer Run** is done by using up all three of your hero's lives by running into goblins without a hammer, with each goblin attack taking away one life. Once all three lives are gone, your score is the number of coins your hero has collected up until that point. As the player progresses, staying alive becomes more and more difficult as the speed of the hero and the rate of spawning goblins increases, until staying alive becomes extremely difficult for even the most skilled players.
